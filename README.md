# Analyze_real_estate_prices_evolution_with_Python

<h1>I. Context</h1>

I did a consulting mission like a BI Analyst in **Les Plus Beaux Logis de Paris**, a prestigious B2B & B2C real estate company.

For financial resaons, this family firm had to sell assets to ensure a sufficient level of cash flow.

The CEO's children were engaged in a real battle because none of them wanted to sell their assets (his son had the private market and his daughter had the corporate market). In fact I had the referee position in that situation.

CEO heard about datascience technics who could predict assets valorization. He asked me to did a study on parisian real estate prices evolution, in order to determine which segments will be the most valuable in couple of years.

<h1>II. Methodology</h1>
  <h2>1. Preparing data </h2>
    <li>Dataset cleaning by removing not necessary data</li>
    <li>Using calculations to create new variables</li>

  <h2>2. Data analysis for values predictions</h2>
    <li>Carrying out correlation tests (Pearson/Spearman) to evaluate relationship between variables</li>
    <li>Prices evolution between private and corporate segments</li>
    <li>Using 'One hot encoding' to prepare data to be ready to train our machine learning algorithm</li>
    <li>Using 'train_test_split' to train and test our supervised algorithm</li>
    <li>Using a Linear regression to predict values of each segments</li>
    
  <h2>3. Data analysis for automatic classification</h2>
    <li>Using DAX language to highlight delay or budget troubles</li>
    <li>Set up roles and authorization levels by using filter rules on data</li>
    <li>Create visualization of Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</li>

  <h2>4. Presentation of results</h2>
    <li>Present the dashboard to the project manager by connecting it with her objectives</li>
